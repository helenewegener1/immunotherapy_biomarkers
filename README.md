# Immunotherapy biomarker calculation 

Testing different calculation methods for enrichment of biomarkers for cancer bulk RNA-seq samples of patients that have recived immunothereapy across multiple studies. 

Testing:
- TPM --> ssGSEA 
- bulkDGD --> DEA --> enrichment score (ES) (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-03104-7)
- bulkDGD --> DEA --> z-scores --> ssSGEA
- Intended calculation of score (some are in signifinder)
